# StayEase: Airbnb Clone Project

## Project Overview

StayEase is a full-stack clone of the popular accommodation platform Airbnb. This web application enables users to browse property listings, view detailed property information, and book accommodations seamlessly. The project is an opportunity to understand end-to-end development of a responsive, user-friendly booking system.

### Goals

- Build a responsive and intuitive UI  
- Implement a secure and scalable backend  
- Practice collaborative development with version control  
- Learn and apply best practices in full-stack development

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React)
- **Backend:** Node.js/Express (optional)
- **Database:** MongoDB or PostgreSQL (optional)
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub
- **Design:** Figma
- **Deployment:** Vercel/Netlify (frontend), Render/Heroku (backend)

## UI/UX Design Planning

### Design Goals

- Create an intuitive booking flow  
- Maintain visual consistency  
- Ensure fast loading and mobile responsiveness  
- Deliver a modern and accessible interface  

### Key Features

- Property search and filtering  
- Detailed property view  
- Secure checkout and booking process  
- User authentication and session handling  

### Primary Pages

| Page Name              | Description                                                                 |
